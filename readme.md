# Envoy - SAML 2.0 Example

This is an example that I have put together to demonstrate how to authenticate
users using SAML 2.0 when using Envoy as an ingress proxy.

To start the example simply clone this repository and run the following command:
```
docker-compose up
```

Envoy is configured to listen on ```localhost:80```.

The username of the example account is ```admin``` and the password is ```password```.

Please be aware that this is an example only and not intended for production use.

I hope that you find my example instructive and I welcome any feedback.
